I'm a software developer who loves to learn and build things.
In my free time I write about what I'm doing on [my blog](/posts) and develop software released as open source on [my GitHub](https://github.com/mbund).

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University.
Last summer I was a Software Development Engineering Intern at AWS on the Amazon Linux kernel team.
In previous years I've had other internships working on frontend software development, and also in cyber security.
