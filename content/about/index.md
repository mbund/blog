I'm a software developer who loves to learn and build things. Nearly all aspects of the software world interest me. I develop [websites written in Rust and TypeScript](https://github.com/rhombusgg/rhombus). I make interpreters for my [custom DSLs](https://crates.io/crates/healthscript). [I improve my efficiency](/posts/cicd-for-university) by building [CLI tools](https://crates.io/crates/canvas-cli). I maintain a [homelab using Kubernetes](/posts/homelab) and use [CI/CD extensively](/posts/advanced-github). I play in cybersecurity CTFs and write [secure embedded systems in Zig](https://github.com/OSU-embedded-security-club/ectf-osu-2025). I [experiment with eBPF](https://github.com/mbund/dimarchos) in the Linux kernel. Sometimes I write about what I'm doing on [my blog](/posts). If it's an innovative technology, I'm probably interested in it.

Currently, I'm a Software Development Engineering Intern working on Linux kernel development at AWS. During the semester I am an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering.

And yes, my bio, "An eigenvector is a eigenvalue in the category of endofunctors" does not mean anything.
