I'm a software developer who loves to learn and build things. I've recently been working with TypeScript and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) to build web applications.

As President of [Cybersecurity Club at OSU](https://osucyber.club), I've had the opportunity to host [BuckeyeCTF](https://ctf.osucyber.club), a cybersecurity competition for students at Ohio State and 100s of participants online from all around the world. Check out my challenges and their solutions in the public [BuckeyeCTF 2023 challenge archive repository](https://github.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2023-public)!

I also self host many services on my home server, including portions of this website. See my [Homelab](/posts/homelab) post to see what I'm running.
