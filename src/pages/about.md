I'm a software developer who loves to learn and build things. I've recently been working with Rust and TypeScript to build web applications.

As President of [Cybersecurity Club at OSU](https://osucyber.club), I've had the opportunity to host [BuckeyeCTF](https://ctf.osucyber.club), a cybersecurity competition for students at Ohio State and 100s of participants online from all around the world.

I also self host many services on my home server, including portions of this website. See my [Homelab](/posts/homelab) post to see what I'm running.
